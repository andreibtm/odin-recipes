<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
  <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
  <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>Your favorite pizza toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5 minutes, or until foamy.</li>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
  <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat.</li>
  <li>Punch down the dough and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a greased pizza pan or parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your favorite toppings.</li>
  <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
  <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
  <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!</li>
